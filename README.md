This repository is for a personal learning project. It goes through a time series forecasting problem for weather data using Pytorch. The goal was to learn how to use Pytorch as well as get a better understanding of new architectures. Read me will be updated with a colab notebook link when the jupyter notebook is finished. Currently the notebook has only done data cleaning, EDA, and build a LSTM in pytorch.
